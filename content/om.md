about
=========================

this is my forum about my favorite dog breed corgis. i made
this with focus on simplicity so anyone could use it. you
can create questions that you then can either answer or comment.
you can also comment on answers if you find them good or bad. the
styling needs work right now but it seems like i dont have time for
 that right now. but if the style dont bother you this is just
a smiple forum for corgi lovers. You need a login to post and comment
but you can view everything even if you're not logged in.
